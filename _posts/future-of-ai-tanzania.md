Artificial intelligence has become ordinary in wealthy markets. In the US and Europe, companies use AI to summarize meetings, draft emails, and search internal documents without thinking twice.

In Tanzania, most of that work still happens manually — in Excel, in WhatsApp groups, and across stacks of scanned PDFs.

The tools that exist today were built for a different context. The Tanzanian market has its own infrastructure, its own payment patterns, and its own languages. That is not a gap to complain about — it is an opening.

## What this market actually needs

Businesses here operate differently. Connectivity is variable. Devices are shared. Payments are not tied to international credit cards. Usage is seasonal, not uniform across the year.

A good AI document tool for this market needs to work within those realities: lightweight enough to run on the infrastructure that exists, priced to match actual usage, and built around the document problems teams here face every day.

## What actually works here

Businesses here need tools that:

- Work on the infrastructure that exists — variable connectivity, shared devices, mobile-first workflows
- Price on a pay-as-you-go model, not an annual contract
- Support Swahili, not just English
- Solve the specific document problems that eat up time: reading contracts, extracting data from forms, answering questions about policies

## What we are building

Ubunifu Insight is our attempt to close this gap. It is an AI document platform built specifically for teams in Tanzania and across Africa.

Upload a document. Ask a question in plain language. Get a cited answer in seconds.

Run a batch extraction across hundreds of PDFs. Export structured data to CSV. Generate reports using your own knowledge base.

Pay only when you use it. No seat fees. No annual contracts.

We built this from here — for the market we know.
