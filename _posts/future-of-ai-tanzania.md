excerpt: "AI tools are everywhere. But most of them are built for companies in San Francisco, not Dar es Salaam. Here is what that gap means — and what we are doing about it."

Artificial intelligence has become ordinary in wealthy markets. In the US and Europe, companies use AI to summarize meetings, draft emails, and search internal documents without thinking twice.

In Tanzania, most of that work still happens manually — in Excel, in WhatsApp groups, and across stacks of scanned PDFs.

This is not because Tanzanian businesses are behind. It is because the tools were not built for them.

## The real problem

Most AI products assume you have reliable internet, a credit card connected to a US bank, and colleagues who speak English as their primary language. They assume you will pay a monthly seat fee regardless of whether you use the product. They assume you want a feature list built for a Silicon Valley enterprise.

That is not the Tanzanian market.

## What actually works here

Businesses here need tools that:

- Work on the infrastructure that exists — variable connectivity, shared devices, mobile-first workflows
- Price on a pay-as-you-go model, not an annual contract
- Support Swahili, not just English
- Solve the specific document problems that eat up time: reading contracts, extracting data from forms, answering questions about policies

## What we are building

Ubunifu Insight is our attempt to close this gap. It is an AI document platform built specifically for teams in Tanzania and across Africa.

Upload a document. Ask a question in plain language. Get a cited answer in seconds.

Run a batch extraction across hundreds of PDFs. Export structured data to CSV. Generate reports using your own knowledge base.

Pay only when you use it. No seat fees. No annual contracts.

We are not adapting a tool built elsewhere. We are building from here.
