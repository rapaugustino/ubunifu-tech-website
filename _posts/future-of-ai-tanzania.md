excerpt: "Most software tools were built for wealthy markets. Tanzania has a different set of needs — and that is an opportunity worth building for."

Most software tools — from document AI to website builders to booking platforms — were designed for markets with fast internet, credit card payments, and English-speaking users.

In Tanzania, businesses operate differently. Payments go through M-Pesa. Connectivity is variable. Devices are shared. The tools that exist today were not built for this context.

That is not a complaint — it is an opening.

## What this market actually needs

Businesses here need software that works within their realities: lightweight enough to run on the infrastructure that exists, priced to match actual usage patterns, and built around the problems teams face every day.

A law firm in Arusha should not have to pay a monthly seat fee for document AI it uses once a quarter. A hotel in Zanzibar should not need a developer to add a booking form to its website. An SME should not have to cobble together five different international tools to run its online presence.

## What we are building

At Ubunifu Technologies, we are building three products to address this:

**Ubunifu Insight** — AI document intelligence for teams. Upload documents, ask questions in plain language, extract structured data, generate reports. Pay only when you use it.

**Ubunifu Rafiki** — Embeddable widgets for Tanzanian businesses. Contact forms, booking tools, and blog widgets that drop into any website. Built for local payment methods and local needs.

**Ubunifu Build** — Custom software, websites, and consulting for businesses that need hands-on expertise. From brand-new web platforms to data pipelines and AI integrations.

## Why we build from here

Every product starts from the workflows, pricing, and infrastructure that exist in Tanzania — not adapted from tools built elsewhere.

M-Pesa and mobile money are first-class payment methods. Swahili is supported alongside English. Pricing follows pay-as-you-go models that match how businesses here actually spend.

We think the next generation of African software companies will be built this way: starting from local needs, not copying foreign solutions and hoping they translate.
