When we were deciding how to price Ubunifu Insight, the obvious move was a monthly subscription. It is what every SaaS company does. Predictable revenue, easy to model, familiar to investors.

We went a different direction.

## The subscription problem in Tanzania

A monthly subscription assumes the user has a consistent, predictable business. It assumes they will use the product every month, at roughly the same level, indefinitely.

That is not how most businesses here work.

A law firm in Dar es Salaam might process a hundred contracts in one month and almost none the next. An NGO might need to extract data from a batch of grant documents once a quarter. An SME might use a tool heavily during tax season and barely touch it otherwise.

Forcing those users onto a monthly seat fee means they pay for months they barely use the product. That is bad for them — and it is the kind of friction that kills adoption.

## Pay as you go

Ubunifu Insight runs on credits. You buy credits when you need them. You use them to index documents, ask questions, run extractions, and generate reports.

If you do not use the product for a month, you do not pay. Your credits do not expire. There are no seat minimums.

For a business with variable workloads, this is the only model that makes sense.

## A secondary benefit: trust

Pay-as-you-go is also an honesty signal. It says: we are confident you will find value in this, so we are not locking you into a contract to guarantee your money.

If Ubunifu Insight stops being useful to you, you stop using it. That is the right relationship between a product and its users.

We think more software companies should work this way — especially ones building for markets where cash flow is unpredictable and trust is earned, not assumed.
